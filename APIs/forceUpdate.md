- `component.forceUpdate(callback)`
- By default, when your component's state or props change, your component will re-render
- If the `render` method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling `forceUpdate()`
- Calling `forceUpdate()` will cause `render()` to be called on the component, skipping `shouldComponentUpdate()`
    - This will trigger the normal lifecycle methods for child components, including the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for each child
    - [ ] React will still update the DOM if the markup changes
- Normally, you should try to avoid all uses of `forceUpdate()` and only read from `this.props` and `this.state` in `render()`
